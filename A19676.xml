            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For among ſo many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ancient and modern, which have written of the Art Militarie, is it not ſtrange that hardly any hath fully handled that which concerneth the Cavallrie? Among the ancients, <hi>Aelian</hi> hath ſomewhat touched upon the manner of ordering the horſe, among the Grecians; and <hi>Vegetius</hi> (where he ſpeaketh of the Romane Cavallrie) lightly paſſeth it over, and concludeth in<note n="a" place="margin">

But for modern authors there is not the like reaſon: and yet of ſo many as have written, none have treated of rules and inſtructions for the Cavall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, untill lately <hi>George Baſta,</hi> Count of the holy Empire, and <hi>Luys Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> wrote their books of Cavallrie.

This defect one <hi>Walhauſen</hi> taketh upon him to ſupply ſomething he hath done in the motions, but for the firſt rudiments, for the handling of arms &amp;c. he (as all others) is ſilent. But theſe and the like being written in the forrain lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and among ſo many of our militarie pamphlets none treating of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallrie; I have adventured (though altogether unfit for ſuch a task) to employ ſome idle houres in the diligent reading, and conferring of the ſaid authors to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſuch other books and informations as I could obtain out of the Low-countreys and other places, for my better ſatisfaction herein:<note n="l" place="margin">Lapides &amp; ligna ab aliis accipio, adificii tamen extructio &amp; forma, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra.

In appointing the lodgings, or places in ſeverall exploits, he muſt be free from partialitie; and ſuch as at this time have cauſe of diſcontent, he muſt make amends the next; that ſo they may ſee it was of neceſſitie, not of partialitie. His place is of very great uſe and importance, as will appeare throughout this diſcourſe.</p>

When the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies be entered into garriſon, the ſouldiers which are on foot muſt preſently be remounted; that ſo, in the time of winter, they may at leiſure fit their horſes for ſervice: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only remounted at the time of their going into the field, the<note n="a" place="margin">

Moreover, thoſe ſouldiers which want horſes are of no ſervice; and theſe are they (uſually) which ſtraggle disbanded, and do moſt miſchief about the quarters. And becauſe oftentimes there is not money aſſigned apart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the ſouldiers, it were good that among the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies there were a brother-hood or fellowſhip erected,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22762:17"/> (which the Spaniſh call <hi>Platta</hi>) which conſiſteth in making a caſh, wherein the money which is gathered to that end, is kept; as followeth. Firſt, the ſouldiers of every companie chooſe foure of their moſt judicious fellows, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Captain. Theſe, with the farrier of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, muſt view all the horſes of their companie, priſing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one according to his value, and concealing it from the ſouldiers, to avoid diſputes: and of this priſing they muſt keep a record, that ſo, if any horſe happen to die, it may be known what is to be allowed; provided alwayes, that they go no higher then 50 crowns. To raiſe this caſh, the Captain muſt give order, that a crown be defalked out of every ſouldiers firſt pay, foure realls out of a third of pay, and eight out of the contributions of a moneth: or elſe this proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be for the firſt beginning, and afterwards the moytie; or more or leſſe as need ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>Every horſe dying in ſervice, or by miſchance, without the ſouldiers fault, ſhall be made good to the ſouldier that loſt him.</p>
                  <p>If a ſouldiers horſe be killed, or otherwiſe die whileſt he is abroad (with the Captains or Officers leave) about his private buſines, he ſhall not be allowed for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>If a ſouldier by negligence or malice hurt his horſe, or uſe him ſo ill that he die; he ſhall not onely beare the loſſe of him, but be chaſtiſed by his ſuperiours, and chaſed from the companie.</p>
                  <p>The Captains muſt take care that the ſaid deputed ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and the farrier viſit all the horſes of the companie once every week: and finding any not fit for ſervice, to ſell them, and buy others.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid deputies muſt admoniſh the ſouldiers to give their horſes good uſe, as is fitting, giving them oats ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; and againſt ſuch as they finde to do otherwiſe, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as aboveſaid.</p>
                  <p>Theſe courſes will be found very available to preſerve the horſe; but when the companies are in the field, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of combats, ſometime twentie, or twentie five, or more horſes being loſt in a day out of one entire companie, in ſuch caſes the ſaid caſh is not of ſufficiencie to ſupplie them, but the Prince is to furniſh them.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Cavallrie being to be exerciſed, muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed how to manage their horſe and their arms.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the horſe (preſuppoſing him to be of ſufficient ſtature and ſtrength, nimble of joynts, and ſure of foot &amp;c.) he muſt (of neceſſitie) be made fit for ſervice, ſo as you may have him ready at command to pace, trot, gallop, or runne in full careere; alſo to advance, ſtop, retire, and turn readily to either hand, and all with alacritie and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now, to bring him to this readie turning, he is to be ridden the ring, and figure 8, firſt in a great compaſſe, and ſo in a leſſe by degrees; firſt upon his pace, then on the trot, and ſo to the gallop and careere. Theſe things he may be taught by uſing the hand, leg and voice. For the hand (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving not to move the arm, but onely the wriſt) if you would have him to face to the left, a little motion of the little finger on that rein, and a touch of the left leg) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:22762:23"/> uſing the ſpurre) doth it: if to face (or turn) to the left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, a harder, &amp;c. If you would have him to trot, you are to move both your legges a little forward; for the gallop, to move them more forward, and for the careere to yerk them moſt forward, and to move the bodie a little forward with it. After every motion performed, it were good to keep him a while in that motion, as when you bid him ſtand, to ſtand a while, &amp;c. Alſo it were not amiſſe, after every thing well done, to give him ſome bread or graſſe as a reward. For the voice, you may uſe the vvords, Advance, hold, turn, or the like, but becauſe the voice cannot alwayes be heard, it were good to uſe him chiefly to the motions of the hand and leg. It will alſo be very uſefull to teach him to go ſidewayes: this he may be brought unto by laying his provender ſomewhat farre from him in the manger, and keeping him from turning his head towards it. He muſt alſo be uſed to the ſmell of gunpowder, the ſight of fire and armour, and the hearing of ſhot, drummes and trumpets, &amp;c. but by degrees and vvith diſcretion. When he is at his oats (at a good diſtance from him) a little povvder may be fired, and ſo nearer to him by degrees. So may a piſtoll be fired ſome diſtance off, and ſo nearer: in like manner a drumme or trumpet may be uſed. The groom may ſometime dreſſe him in armour, and he may be uſed (novv and then) to eat his oats from the drumme head. It vvill be very uſefull ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to cauſe a musketier to ſtand at a convenient diſtance, and both of you to give fire upon each other, and thereupon to ride up cloſe to him: alſo to ride him againſt a compleat armour, ſo ſet upon a ſtake, that he may overthrovv it, and trample it under his feet: that ſo (and by ſuch other means) your horſe (finding that he receiveth no hurt) may become bold to approach any object. He may alſo be uſed to moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanous and uneven vvayes, and be exerciſed to leap, ſvvimme, and the like. But for further directions for the art of riding and managing the horſe, I referre the reader to<note n="a" place="margin">Beſides many of our owne writers; <hi>Pierre de la Noüe</hi> in his Cavallerie Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choiſe et Italienne. <hi>alſo</hi> Inſtruction du Roy (de France) en l'exercice de mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Cheval, par Antoyne de Plubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. lately publiſhed, and divers others.</note> them vvhich have vvritten of horſe-manſhip <hi>ex profeſso,</hi> vvhoſe books are every vvhere obvious.</p>

                  <p>The manner of carrying the lance, is either advanced, or couched, that is, when it is carried ſo abaſed, as the enemie can hardly diſcover it untill he feel the ſhock.</p>
                  <p>The charging of the lance is twofold, either by the right, or left.</p>
                  <p>The right is, when it is preſented or charged along by the right ſide of the horſe.</p>
                  <p>The left is, when it is born acroſſe the neck of the horſe, by the left eare.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the manner uſed by the Turks and Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and by ſome preferred before the other. One reaſon which they give for it, is, becauſe that in charging by the left, the Lancier muſt incline his bodie to the left, and ſo ſitteth the leſſe ſure in his ſaddle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baſta</hi> would have the ſecond way to be beſt. Howſoever, all agree that a Lancier muſt ever ſtrive to gain the left ſide of his enemie, and charge him on the left.</p>
                  <p>Now there be three wayes of charging; </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 By carrying the lance ſloaped upwards.</item>
                     <item>2 By charging it levell, in a ſtraight line.</item>
                     <item>3 By charging it ſloaping, or inclining downwards.</item>

                  </figure>
                  <p>The ſecond is, by charging a horſe-man about the middle, (to bear him out of the ſaddle) or on the breaſt of the foot.</p>
                  <p>The third ſerveth to pierce the breaſt of the enemies horſe, or a kneeling musketier, or pike charging at the foot againſt horſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three ſeverall wayes muſt be diligently practiſed, and require much dexteritie: to which end a ſtake is to be ſet up, having an arm (as it were) ſtretched out from it, and thereunto a white (either of paper or linen) faſtned, at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heights, which the Lancier muſt exerciſe himſelf to hit in full careere; alſo to take up a glove (or the like) from the ground with the point of his lance, &amp;c. All which is ſhown <hi>figure</hi> 2. <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 28.

Againſt an armed Lancier, the beſt way of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging is judged to be, not after the two firſt wayes, but by the third, that is, at the breaſt of the horſe, and that towards the left ſide of him, where his heart and vitals are; and for this, the charging by the right is held beſt.</p>
                  <p>Having given his charge with the lance, ſo as it becometh unuſefull to him, he muſt betake himſelf to his piſtoll, in the uſe whereof he is to be very skilfull. His laſt refuge is his ſword, which he muſt alſo be well practiſed in. Of both which weapons ſhall be ſpoken in the next chapter.</p>

                  <p>With the right thumbe he is to thruſt back the back-lock, and ſo to give the cock libertie.</p>
                  <p>But the more compendious way of lading, for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of time (which in the inſtant of skirmiſh is chiefly to be regarded) is by uſing cartouches. Now, the cartouch is to be made of white paper, cut out of convenient breadth and length, and rowled upon a ſtick, (or the rammer, if it be not too little) fit (according to the bore of the barrell) to contain a due quantitie of powder, &amp; the bullet. The proportion of powder uſually required is half the weight of the bullet; but that is held too much by ſuch as can judge. Having moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the paper, the one end of it is to be turned in (to keep in the powder) and the due charge of powder to be put into it, at the other end; which powder is to be cloſed in by tying a little thred about the paper: then the bullet is to be put in, and that alſo tyed in with a little thred. When the Cuiraſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is to uſe his cartouch, he muſt bite off the paper at the head of it, and ſo put it into the barrell of his piſtoll, with the bullet upward, and then ramme it home. By<note n="b" place="margin">For the more ſpeedy lading of the piſtoll, and avoiding the trouble of carrying either flaſque or touchbox, there is a late invented faſhion of ſpanner or key, (which I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in <hi>figure</hi> 1) which contains ſix charges of powder (at the leaſt) and priming powder ſufficient for thoſe charges, &amp; for the cartouches where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the piſtoll caſes be furniſhed: which the Cuiraſſier will finde to be of very good uſe, when he is uſed thereunto.</note> this means he ſhall much expedite the lading of his piſtoll. The Cuiraſſier being become ready in his poſtures, his next (and chiefeſt) ſtudy is, to be an exact marks man. And to this end he muſt frequently be practiſed at ſome<note n="c" place="margin">The Romanes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed their ſouldiers at ſeverall heights at ſtakes ſet up in <hi>Campo Martio.

Now becauſe the Cuiraſſier is armed piſtoll proof, he muſt not give fire but at

If he fail of an opportunitie to hurt the man, he may aime at the breaſt of the horſe, or his head, as he ſhall ſee occaſion. He uſually giveth his charge upon the trot, and ſeldome gallopeth, unleſſe it be in purſuit of a flying enemie, or ſuch like occaſion. Having ſpent both his piſtols, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time to lade again, his next refuge is his ſword; whereof the beſt manner of uſing is to place the pummell of it upon his right<note n="f" place="margin">As is ſhewed in the <hi>poſture</hi> 22.</note> thigh, and ſo with his right hand to direct or raiſe the point to his mark, higher or lower as occaſion ſerveth: either at the bellie of the adverſe horſe-man (about the pummell of the ſaddle) or at his arm pits, or his throat, where if it pierce not, (as it is very like it will not fail, by ſlipping under the caſque) yet meeting with a ſtay in that part of the bodie, where a man is very weak, and having a ſword of a very ſtiffe blade, (as afore-ſaid) it will doubtleſſe unhorſe him. Being paſt his enemie, he is to make a back-blow at him, aiming to cut the buckle of his pouldron, whereby he diſarmeth one of his arms, &amp;c. <hi>Baſta</hi> highly commendeth the aiming at the enemies fight, and ſo (by raiſing the vizures of his caſque with the point of the ſword to runne him into the head. But this ſeemeth not ſo likely to take effect as that of aiming at the throat; and ſometimes (as ſome caſques are made) it would be of no uſe.</p>
                  <p>In theſe and the like exerciſes the Cuiraſſier is frequently and diligently to practiſe himſelf at ſome mark; which will render him fit for ſervice when need ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>Some authors (for the diſpoſing of the Cuiraſſiers for fight) hold that they ought to be ordered in groſſe bodies, that ſo (<note n="g" place="margin">The Cuiraſſiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the horſe, are like the <hi>gravis armatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> of foot among the Romanes, <hi>quae tanquam murus ferreus ſtabat, &amp; ſi hoſtes fugâſſet, non ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebatur; quia ejus jus eſt, facilè nec fugere, nec ſequi.</hi> Veg. lib. 2. cap. 17.

                  <p>And here, before we enter into the motions, it were fit to explain the terms of<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <p>The Graecians and Romanes had the ſame order of exerciſe, and that in the ſame words, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this day.</p>
                        <p>A file, the Romanes called <hi>Verſus,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curia:</hi> A rank, <hi>Jugum.</hi> A file-leader, <hi>Decanus,</hi> becauſe their <hi>decuria</hi> (or file) uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of 10 among the foot, with ſome 16. a bringer up, <hi>Tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor:</hi> a leader (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every odde man in the file) <hi>Proſtes:</hi> a follower (which is every even number) <hi>Subſtes:</hi> a ſide-man, <hi>Aſtes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Their diſtances were the ſame with us. Their 2 cubits (every cubit being a foot and an half of our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) agreed with our 3 foot. Their 4 cubits, our 6 foot: and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They ordered their horſe-troops at 6 foot diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween file and file, in march, and 3 foot in fight.</p>
                     </note> art therein uſed, and to ſhew what is meant by a file, a rank, half files, and half ranks; the front, flanks, and reere, and the like. But (for brevitie ſake) I paſſe them over, referring the reader to the books of Infanterie.</p>
                  <p>To exerciſe the horſe, they are to be drawn up into a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, not by ranks, but by files: and thoſe of 5 deep, as moſt affirm, or of 6, as others would have it, and that becauſe the number of 5 is not diviſible by 2, and ſo in doubling of ranks, or half files, or the like, there is alwaies an odde rank. Some would have them (eſpecially the Harquebuſiers) to be 8 in file, taking the troop to conſiſt of 64. Being put in <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> that is, ordered into a ſquare bodie, and ſilence ſtrictly commanded; the firſt thing to be taught them, is diſtance. And herein authors diſagree. Some make cloſe order to be 2 paces; open order, 4 paces, and ſo for double, triple, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple diſtance proportionable. Others make but 2 kindes of diſtances: Cloſe order, which is 3 foot: and open order, which is 6 foot. But this muſt be underſtood <hi>cum grano ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:</hi> (as the Civilians ſpeak) for here we muſt obſerve a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the manner of taking the diſtance of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallrie, and that of the Infanterie: for in the foot, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is taken from the center of the ſouldiers bodie, which here cannot be ſo underſtood, but onely of the ſpace of ground between horſe and horſe.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>de Praiſſac</hi> is more plain, who would have the diſtance between rank and rank (both for the length of the horſe, as alſo for the ſpace between horſe and horſe) to be ſix paces, &amp; one pace between file and file. Yet, if we take every pace for five foot (as that is the uſuall dimention) by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:22762:32"/> this rule they ſhould be at a verie large diſtance.</p>
                  <p>In my opinion, the Cavallrie, being to be exerciſed in their motions, ſhould be at ther diſtance of ſix foot, or open order (taking it as hath been ſhewed) <hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſtanding right in their ranks and files.<note n="b" place="margin">Omnes milites inceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di ordinem ſervent. <hi>Veg. 1.9.</hi>

                  <p>The uſe of wheelings, is to bring the front (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſuppoſed to conſiſt of the ableſt men) to be readie to receive the charge of the enemie on either flank or reere.</p>

                  <p>In the aſſailing of his quarter, there are two things to be obſerved;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To make your approaches as neare the village as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible may be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<note n="c" place="margin">In campis sparſis atque ſecuris, opportunum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium infertur, exceptis ſuperventibus vel incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus repentium ex occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione, quam nunquam dux exercitatus amittit. <hi>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 19</hi>
                     </note> To hinder him from uniting his troops into a bodie.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt, the firſt troop ſhall advance (without any forerunners) as ſecretly as may be: and aſſoon as they perceive themſelves to be diſcovered (without looſing a moment of time) ſhall charge the Sentinels, and enter the quarter with them, and ſurpriſe the Corps-de-guard before they be able to mount on horſeback.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, there muſt be an exquiſite obſervance of the orders given, and not a man to disband. Suppoſe the enemie hath 1000 horſe and you but 500, you may fitly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide your forces into five troops. The firſt having ſurpriſed the Corps-de-guard (as before mentioned) ſhall from thence paſſe to the market-place, with reſolution to ſuſtain any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which they ſhall meet with. The ſecond troop (perceiving the quarter inveſted) ſhall follow upon the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop cloſely united, and finding no reſiſtance, ſhall poſſeſſe the alarm place, and ſend ſome horſe to run through the ſtreets, to keep the ſouldiers in; and to hinder them from mounting on horſeback.</p>
                  <p>The third ſhall come fairely on to the ſaid place, and ſo the fourth; which (leaving the third there firm) ſhall haſten to the place where they heare the moſt noiſe: then ſhall they alight and enter the houſes, putting to the ſword what enemies they finde. The running of theſe horſe through the ſtreets, hindering the ſouldiers to mount, will ſurely make them think rather<note n="d" place="margin">Nec inſequentium ul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lum periculum eſt, cùm victi (quibus defendi po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terant) arma converterint in fugam. <hi>Ibid. cap. 21.</hi>
                     </note> of eſcaping by flight through the gardens or otherwiſe, then of reſiſting: neither can there (in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:22762:55"/> ſuch a tumult) be good orders given or obſerved. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fift troop hearing the noiſe ceaſe, may conjecture there is no need of there help to take the village; and ſo ſhall divide themſelves into two parts, and inviron the quarter on the outſide, to hinder the enemies flight on foot. The horſe-boyes may fire a houſe or two, eſpecially where the enemie ſhall endeavour to fortifie: then (as the ſouldiers) to enter the houſes to pillage and take pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Another way of aſſailing the quarter, is this. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies camp removing, the Chief or Captain muſt labour to inform himſelf of the place where he purpoſeth to lodge that night; and where the quarter for the Cavallrie ſhall be: which may eaſily be learned, becauſe overnight it is uſually publiſhed: or having good knowledge of the countrey, he may conjecture it. He muſt conſider the number of his enemies horſe, and of his owne, and though he be inferiour by half (as beforeſaid) yet may his enterpriſe take good effect, if it be well carried. He muſt fit the time<note n="e" place="margin">Nam vel celeriùs vel tardiùs aliquò pervenire quàm conſtitutum est, propoſitum perſaepe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum intervertit. <hi>Leo Tact. cap. 15. 42.</hi>
                     </note> ſo juſtly, as that he may come to the enemies quarter in the evening, before the guards be diſpoſed, or the orders given. And if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance were ſuch, as that he muſt march when the enemie marcheth, he ſhall depart from his quarter with all ſecrecie, and<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <p>A good commander (like a good wraſtler) ought to make ſhew of one thing, and to put another in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: to the end to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the enemie, and gain the victorie. <hi>Ibid. cap.</hi> 20.</p>

                     </note> pretend to march to ſome other place, taking a way contrarie to that which leadeth to the place intended.

The retreat ſhall be by the ſame way you went, ſo long as day continues; but night being come, you muſt take ſome other way (though the longer) to return to your garriſon, or quarter. Thus you ſhall gain time by turning away from the enemie by the benefite of the night; cauſing the footing of your horſes to be defaced at the place where you left the way, for it is to be ſuppoſed the enemie will follow you by the direct way. To deface or put out the footing of the horſe, if the way be duſtie, two ſouldiers are appointed to ſtay behinde all the reſt, which draw a great bough betwen them along the ground, and ſo put out the marks of the horſes footing. Or if there be a great number of horſe, and the way be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:22762:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> broad, then foure ſouldiers with two boughs do it. But if the way be ſoft, the Chief commandeth five or ſix ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to alight, and with their hands and feet to deface the footings; and in ſuch wayes the horſe are commanded to march with doubled files and cloſed, for a little ſpace when they turn out of the uſuall way, that ſo they may trample the leſſe. Beſides, you may avoid the danger of being traced by the horſe footings (eſpecially in the night) by turning out of the way at ſome houſe, or through ſome garden, breaking the hedge on the further ſide, and going into the way by wayes unthought off: by all which means you gain time, whileſt the enemie is conſtrained to ſpend time in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your footing, and taking informatiom of the way that you took.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we come to ſhew the ſeverall forms of battell which may be uſed among the Cavall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, it will be fit to ſpeak of their ſeverall kindes of fighting, which they are to be practiſed in apart by themſelves, before they be joyned with the groſſe.</p>
                  <p>If a companie of Lances were to fight againſt foot, they were not to give their charge in an united bodie (neither upon this, nor any occaſion whatſoever) becauſe even the ſecond rank of them hardly doth any certain execution; but they were to charge them rank after rank, wheeling off to the reare; to that end keeping large diſtances between rank and rank. The ſame order they were to obſerve, if they fought againſt horſe upon the offenſive. For the defenſive, the companie (conſiſting of 64, as before, <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.) might order themſelves in this manner. Two ranks (of 8 in rank) ſhould face to the front: two to either flank, and two to the reare; leaving an open ſquare ſpace in the middle, they all ſtanding back towards back, faced every way, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the charge whereſoever the enemie ſhall give on.</p>
                  <p>The ſame manner might be uſed in greater bodies, as ſhould ſeem good to the skilfull Commander. If the Lances were to fight againſt Cuiraſſiers,<note n="a" place="margin">Par. 3. rangs de lances lui aller gail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lardement donner par les flancs: car par ce moyen ils l'entr' ouuriront. <hi>Monſieur de la Noüe.

                  <p>If one companie of Cuiraſſiers be to fight againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, your enemie charging you in full career, you are to make a<note n="b" place="margin">So <hi>Walhauſen</hi> would have it.</note> Carracoll, that is, you divide your body by the half ranks, and ſo ſuddenly open to the right and left; ſo as the enemie paſſeth through you, and you (facing inward) charge him on the flanks, as is ſhewed in <hi>Fig.</hi> 6. <hi>Part.</hi> 4. Or if two companies fight againſt two other, then they obſerve the ſame manner, but keeping each companie entire, as may be ſeen in the ſame figure.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:22762:61"/>
                  <p>It is alſo to be done by the Carracoll firſt, and then (the enemie being within you) to wheel to the right and left inward, and ſo to charge him on the reare, in full career.

But others do utterly reject it, as too much expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to inevitable danger. In their firing by ranks, the firſt rank advanceth ſome 30 paces before the bodie, firſt on the gallop, then in career (as ſome direct) and ſo to give fire: the ſecond doth the ſame, and ſo the reſt.

                  <p>But if the ſaid Infanterie be put in good order at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, (if the ground be champain, and the number equall) yet may they be charged by the horſe: Firſt by ſome troops of Harquebuſiers (or rather Dragons, becauſe they do execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at a larger diſtance) which ſhall give on on their front, flanks, and reare.

                  <p>If the Infanterie exceed in number, and ſo be ſerried in a groſſe body, it will be hard for the Cavallrie to rout them, as hath been found by experience by the Swiſſes, which ſtill had the better of the horſe, by reaſon of their groſſe bodies of pikes.</p>
                  <p>If the Infanterie be ordered into ſeverall battallions, the horſe are to charge them where they perceive them moſt open and naked.

                  <p>The Divided, eſpecially at ſo large a diſtance, I hold to be dangerous. True it is, that here the Dragons are uſed as foot, but whether ſo ſingle and ſo extended an order be the beſt for them to be placed in, I referre to the judicious.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning theſe ſix kindes of battells, they are in deed and in effect but two: that is, the Checquer and the Lunarie, as he calleth them; and from theſe grounds the reſt be formed.</p>
                  <p>But theſe forms being onely imaginarie, and withall wanting that perfection (in many reſpects) which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in reall battells, I ſhall now (to give fuller ſatisfaction to ſuch as are lovers of militarie knowledge) communicate ſome forms of embattellings, which never yet were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by any.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:22762:67"/>
                  <p>Theſe are true delineations of divers battells really or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and performed by the abſoluteſt Commanders of our times, according to the exacteſt rules of art; and ſuch as experience hath approved to be fitteſt for the modern warres.</p>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding whereof, I have thought fit firſt to put down theſe directions following.</p>
                  <p>All the forces of the whole armie (both horſe and foot) are uſually diſtinguiſhed and divided into<note n="h" place="margin">So did the Romanes; the Vanguard they called <hi>Cornu dextrum,</hi> the Battell <hi>Acies media,</hi> and the Reare <hi>Cornu ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrum;</hi> as is ſhewed by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cl. Edmonds,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Caeſars Com. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. out of <hi>Lipſius de milit. Rom. lib.</hi> 4. and is handled at large by <hi>Leo</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <hi>Tact. cap.</hi> 18.</note> three parts, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Vanguard, Battell, and Reare. (as hath been ſhewed Part. 2. chap. 3.) Each of which parts is governed by it's particular Officer or Chief; yet ſo as the abſolute command belongeth to the Generall. Theſe diſtinctions are alwayes ſo underſtood, in the order of marching, to avoid diſputes about precedencie; ſo as they which march foremoſt are ſaid to have the Vanguard, they which march in the middle, the Battell, and they which come laſt the Reare. And theſe diviſions alter their names according to the place they march in, wherein they obſerve a diuinall change, as hath been ſhewed in the chapter above mentioned. But if we ſhall take the meaning of theſe words (according to their proprietie and uſuall acceptation) in matter of fight or bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, conceiving that that part of the armie which is called the Vanguard ſhall give the firſt charge; and that which is called the Battell, ſhall give the ſecond charge, &amp; the Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the laſt; it will prove a meere miſtake. For we are to know that the firſt charge muſt be given by the firſt troop, or foremoſt order of companies which are in front placed as in one rank, extended from the one front-angle of the whole armie, to the other: and ſo it were impoſſible for them to be commanded or directed by one Commander, or Chief of one particular ſquadron of the armie, by reaſon of the large extent thereof: for we ſee that the front of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie embattelled before <hi>Dornick. Fig.</hi> 14. (which was farre inferiour to that of late, employed at the ſiedge of the <hi>Boſſch</hi>) took up<note n="i" place="margin">Six foot make a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, 100 fathoms a furlong, ſeven fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs and a half, a mile. Five foot make a pace, 1000 paces make a mile.</note> 6380 foot of ground (being in their cloſe order prepared for fight) which is above a mile and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if the Vanguard (as it is called) ſhould give the firſt charge, the Battell (which then muſt ſecond them) may
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:22762:67"/> chance to be of a nation not onely differing from the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, but at variance with them, or elſe ſome grudge or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt between the Chiefs. And in that reſpect they might either neglect or ſlacken the ſeconding or relieving of thoſe of the Vanguard, and not uſe that diligence which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. In conſideration therefore of theſe and other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, it is beſt that every ſquadron of the armie be ſo ordered, as each of them may have their firſt, ſecond, and third troops: by which means every diviſion ſhall both be commanded by their own Chiefs, and ſhall alſo be ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe of their own ſquadron, or diviſion; which will give them the more courage and aſſurance. The manner therefore for the ordering of an armie for battell, is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. That ſquadron which is called the Battell, is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the middle, the Vanguard on the right hand of it, and the Reare on the left: and all theſe (uſually) in one front and ſingle order; one regiment (or ſometimes one compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, eſpecially among the horſe as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 10.) flanking the other, as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>From hence the firſt troop of every diviſion is drawn up, and placed in an even front or ſtraight line, from one angle of the bodie to the other. At a convenient<note n="k" place="margin">Uſually 300 foot.</note> diſtance behinde theſe, the ſecond troop of every ſquadron is placed, in an even rank, as the former; but ſo as the<note n="l" place="margin">The Romanes alſo ordered their battells in three diviſions, or troops: <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arii.</hi> The firſt were called <hi>Acies prima,</hi> and theſe were the <hi>Haſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> which were to give the firſt charge. At a diſtance behinde them were the <hi>Principes</hi> placed, which were called <hi>Acies ſecunda:</hi> theſe were ſo ordered with ſpaces or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valles, that the <hi>Haſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> (being put to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat) might fall back into theſe ſpaces, and the <hi>Principes</hi> might advance to give the ſecond charge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbing each other. The third troop <hi>(Acies tertia)</hi> were the <hi>Triarii,</hi> which were placed behinde the <hi>Principes,</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therein ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalles as before mentioned. <hi>Vide Livi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um lib.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp; Lipſium de milit.

                     </note> firſt troop (which are to give the firſt charge) being to retreat, and this ſecond troop to advance, they diſturb not each other: for which reaſon, convenient ſpaces are left in the firſt order or troop, for the ſecond to come up into. The third troop is placed juſt behinde the firſt, but at twice as large a<note n="m" place="margin">600 foot.</note> diſtance from the ſecond, as the ſecond is from the firſt: that ſo the firſt troop retreating behinde the ſecond, they may have convenient room to make their retreat in good order. All this will appeare in the figures following, among the reſt in <hi>Fig.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>If the Infanterie and Cavallrie be joyned together, the manner is to place half the horſe on the right flank of the foot, and the other half on the left, as appeareth in <hi>Fig.</hi> 12, 14, and 15. But upon occaſion either of the enemie his ordering of horſe within the bodie of foot, whereby he might annoy your Infanterie; or for other reſpects of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:22762:68"/> ſome of the horſe may be placed within the bodie of the armie, as is ſhewed in <hi>Fig.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>What diſtances be obſervable, between Regiment and Regiment, between Squadron and Squadron, betwen each Troop, the ſecond from the firſt, and the third from the ſecond, the figures will ſufficiently ſhew, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Scales of meaſure in every figure.

               <p>THus have I breifly (according to my weak abilitie) runne through that part of the Art militarie, which principally concerneth the Cavallrie: Which ſubject I have the rather choſen to treat of, becauſe it is ſo little and ſo ſparingly handled by thoſe that have given us dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for warre, and leſſe obſerved in our ordinarie practiſe,<note n="a" place="margin">Witneſſe thoſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſharp repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, expreſſed in his Majeſties letters, from time to time: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, <hi>that of the</hi> 21 <hi>of September.</hi> 1628, from <hi>Windſor.</hi> And the continuall &amp; ſerious callings upon for reformation, by the letter, from the Lords of his Majeſties moſt honourable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie counſell, and the right honourable the Lords Lieutenants of every county.</note> eſpecially in the exerciſe of our trained troops here at home.
